I developed a fully functional E-Commerce website using Java Spring Boot for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. The platform includes features such as product management, user authentication, shopping cart, payment gateway integration, and order tracking. MySQL was used for the database, while Docker was utilized for containerization. The project also involved designing responsive layouts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This solution was built to be scalable and optimized for performance, providing a seamless shopping experience."
